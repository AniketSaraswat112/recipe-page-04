## 📚 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me:

- Improve my use of **semantic HTML**, especially with sections like `<article>`, `<section>` and accessible tables.
- Understand how to build **mobile-first layouts** using Tailwind and refine breakpoints.
- Work with **Tailwind utilities** for spacing, typography, and responsive design.
- Create **accessible lists**, including the use of custom markers where needed.
- Structure nutritional information using proper `<table>` semantics (`<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="row">`).
